          The varying designs in premium gutter profiles (mostly cast aluminium & iron) have not changed much over the past few decades but there have been several new additions. These are more contemporary and suit changing architecture that appears in modern construction nationwide. As well as the gutter range, there is a variety of pipes that can be cast eared to mirror the old cast iron style, these are available in versatile dimensions.
          <br><br>
          Recently, hopper heads are becoming more appealing and popular within the construction industry and sizes can vary from  170mm wide up to around 900mm in width. Motifs and ornamental designs can be incorporated, even a year date (e.g. 2017) can be added to hopper heads for the individual needs of a customer if desired.
          <br><br>
          New additions to the range include fascia cappings and soffits, these are becoming increasingly more popular especially on new build projects. The extremely low maintenance fascias and soffits, that simply need a clean off once a year, is a huge incentive for potential customers with the ever busy lifestyle. The production of fascias and soffits are manufactured with the aid of CAD technology.
          <br><br>
          All aluminium products are polyester powder coated throughout, with a full range of colours available from RAL or British Standards Colours. There are also options for colour matching Farrow & Ball colours, should this be required. Cast-iron rainwater products, ogee and half round with circular or square/rectangular pipes are also all stocked and available to be supplied and installed.

            <p>
              Victorian ogee guttering and number 46 type are more suited to older style properties or listed properties. Colours are mostly black or white to satisfy local authority but there's potentially a choice of colours in the RAL & BS range.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Fitting can be with the use of either fascia, rafter or rise & fall brackets depending on roof structure. Cast half round gutters are once again more suited to older period style properties and are also available in the full colour range. The beaded half round gutter is a more contemporary style and produced roll formed in sectional form, colours are available as standard over the full RAL & BS range.
